# Intro to Commands

The first command that is:
> ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college

is used to connect to the hacker@dojo.pwn.college website by authenticating the public keys. It checks the public key stored in the file key and compares it to the one stored in pwn
```bash
coolguy24@Vedant-Laptop:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MEN7VZUpSFOVOY9FahCDQkfMQaV.ddjNyUDL2AjN0czW}
```
The resources that I used were the Whatsapp video forwarded by my mentor.
