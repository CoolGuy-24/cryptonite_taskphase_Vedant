# Learning Complex Usage
I understood that is possible for an argument to take an argument again to function. So for this challenge, the `--printfile` argument would have needed the argument `/flag` to print out the flag so I ran that and obtained the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{4MZck5NDe-e83-Yy0SkHMaFxc0Q.dVjM5QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource that was the pwn website.
