# Setting PATH
I set the `PATH` variable to the directory in which the `win` command was present and then running the `/challenge/run` command gave me the flag.
```bash
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
