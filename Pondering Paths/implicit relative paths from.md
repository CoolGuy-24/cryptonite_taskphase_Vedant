# Implicit relative paths, from /
Using the `cd` command I changed the directory to `/` so that it becomes my cwd. Then using the relative path, I accessed the flag.

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Mk9N0WW_R7zxdCV4N1wwREdafDX.dlDN1QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
