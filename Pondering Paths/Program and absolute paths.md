# Program and absolute paths

The flag was stored inside the run program in the challenge directory so I accessed it using its full path.

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QNPtAYaArXccpD7mqa08hD5Ecat.dVDN1QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
