# Executable Shell Scripts
Using `nano` I created a shell script called `script.sh` which invoked the command `/challenge/solve` and then gave it executable permissions using `chmod u+x`. Thenn I executed the shell script using `./script.sh`
```bash
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ nano script.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod u+x script.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./script.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
