# Your First Shell Script
Using the `nano` command I created a shell script called `x.sh` and then inside it I wrote the two commands and saved it using `Ctrl+O` and exited the script using `Ctrl+X`. Using `bash` I executed the script.
```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
