# Chaining with Semicolons
Using `;` I was able to run both the commands in one line right after one another.
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Y6efV_hPDxcAgOWlbW5HQ6fUA7R.dVTN4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
