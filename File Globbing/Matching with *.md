# Matching with *
I knew that to switch to the directory of `/challenge ` I would require the `/` character and the other two wooul dbe the starting and last letter, so using that I switched directories with the help of the `cd` command.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*e
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cWaqXoHencYfgFmUB2PhTvg-9-r.dFjM4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Reosurce used was the pwn website.
