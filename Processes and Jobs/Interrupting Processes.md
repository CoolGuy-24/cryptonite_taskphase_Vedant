# Interrupting Processes
I ran the `/challenge/run` program and then interrupted it successfully by `Ctrl+C` command.
```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MMzn0f_2VPiqIGToEkD0Mt36uTL.dNDN4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn webiste.
