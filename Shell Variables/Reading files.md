# Reading files
The `<` character helped me redirect `/challenge/read_me` 's output into the standard input of read. 
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{86SV_oJeOdrQf4YtjXY0BzwVsn-.dBjM4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website
