# Reading input
I used the `read` command to read the input from the user (me). I typed the value `COLLEGE` to set the value of `PWN` to that.
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{c-JMibJIbrfJvyixKLGj_2aRPFQ.dhzN1QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
