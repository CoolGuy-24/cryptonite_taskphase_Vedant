# Making Directories
Using the `cd` comamnd I switched to the `/tmp` directory and then using the `mkdir` command I created a new directory named `pwn`. Finally using the `touch` command I created a new file.
```bash
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ mkdir pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ ls
college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{M_FcVwaLNB4NY8TPZPkYoJfZ6Fc.dFzM4QDL2AjN0czW}
```

Resoruce used was the pwn website.
