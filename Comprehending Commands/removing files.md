# Removing files
I used the `ls` command to view the files in the home directory and then used the `rm` command to remove the `delete_me` file and finally acceesed the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
 delete_me  '~'
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
