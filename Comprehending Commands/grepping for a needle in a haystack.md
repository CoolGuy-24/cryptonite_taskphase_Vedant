# Grepping for a needle in a haystack 
Since the flag always starts with `pwn.college`, I used the `grep ` comamnd to search it in the `/challenge/data.txt` directory.
```bash
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{kWpcp73Jba3YfEarRjy9u-ARAya.ddTM4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
