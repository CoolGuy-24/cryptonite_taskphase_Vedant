# cat: not the pet, but the command!
The flag was stored in the `flag` file so using the `cat` command which concatentes or reads files, I used it to read the file and get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{o_SoRIbcrwG9D2XF-Y3MXjqazoS.dFzN1QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
