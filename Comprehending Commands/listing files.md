# Listing Files
Using the `ls` command I identified the file present in the `/challenge` directory. Then I simply accessed the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
30717-renamed-run-8031  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/30717-renamed-run-8031
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kwm9x4shSCuDDj1dk1CcNaWDEP8.dhjM4QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
