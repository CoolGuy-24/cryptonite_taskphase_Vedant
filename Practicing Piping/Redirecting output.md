# Redirecting output
I had to redirect the output `PWN` to the file `COLLEGE` and to do that I used the `>` character.
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{wB-PIGFZ2iCajqc4EkwJnZ0iIFT.dRjN1QDL2AjN0czW}
```
Resource used was the pwn website.
