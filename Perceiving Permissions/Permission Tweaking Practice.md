# Permission Tweaking Practice
Using various combinations of `u,g,o` and `+/-` and `r,w,x` I was able to change the permissions. `r,w,x` were used to give/take permissions of read, wrtie and execute. The `+/-` specified if the permission was given or taken. The `u,g,o` specified to who the permission was granted, the user, the group or the world. 
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
