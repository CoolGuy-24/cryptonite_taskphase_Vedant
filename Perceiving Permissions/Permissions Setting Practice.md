# Permissions Setting Practice
In this challenge, I used the combinations of `r,w,x`,`u,g,o` and `=` to set permissions accordingly. The `=` assigns the usergroup/world only the permissions mentioned after it and removes any permission not present after it. The `=-` argument will remove all the permissions of the user/group/world.
```bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r /flag
